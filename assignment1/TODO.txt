generate the sphere and cache them

start easy with a simple function that is a reward, normalize the reward and the observation based on the distance reach from the drone
gives reward when the drone continue to the x axix and not when go back

defining starting point of the drone -5 or -10 in the x

avoid reward hacking -> infinite reward
